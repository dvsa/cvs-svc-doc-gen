        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>1. Notification of refusal to issue a Low Emissions Certificate</h3>
        <p> In order for vehicles to drive within the London Low Emission Zone (LEZ),
            vehicles must satisfy the London LEZ emissions standards. The LEZ emissions
            standards can be found on the Transport for London website:
            <strong>www.tfl.gov.uk/lezlondon</strong></p>
        <h3>Vehicles with a current Low Emissions Certificate</h3>
        <p> If this Notification of refusal has been issued in respect of a vehicle that has a current
            Low Emissions Certificate, you must take action within 14 days to rectify the technical
            deficiencies identified overleaf and obtain a new Low Emissions Certificate. If the vehicle
            does not meet the LEZ emissions standards and a Low Emissions Certificate is not issued
            within 14 days, your certificate will be revoked and the vehicle will be subject to a
            daily charge to drive within the LEZ.</p>
        <h3>Vehicles without a current Low Emissions Certificate</h3>
        <p> If this Notification of refusal has been issued in respect of a vehicle which does not
            meet the London LEZ emissions standards and a Low Emissions Certificate has not been
            issued, then the vehicle will be subject to a daily charge to drive within the LEZ. If
            however, the technical deficiencies listed overleaf are rectified and the vehicle meets
            the LEZ emissions standards and a Low Emissions Certificate is issued, then the test
            results will be transferred to TfL within 3 days and the vehicle will be able to drive
            within the LEZ without being subject to the daily charge.</p>

        <h3>2. Obtaining a new Low Emissions Certificate test</h3>
        <p>To book a new Low Emissions Certificate test at a DVSA test centre you should apply by
            telephone on <strong>0300 123 9000</strong>.</p>

        <h3>3. Retention and production of this document</h3>
        <p> You are advised to keep this refusal notification readily available. You must present it when you take the vehicle to be re-inspected.</p>
        <p> Transport for London will be informed within 3 days of issue or withdrawal of this notification by DVSA. <br/>
