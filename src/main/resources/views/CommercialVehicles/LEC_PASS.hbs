        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>1. London Low Emission Zone – Low Emissions Certificates </h3>
        <p>This <strong>Low Emissions Certificate (LEC)</strong> is confirmation that the vehicle has been examined on the
            date specified overleaf and found to have been constructed or adapted so as to satisfy the London
            LEZ emissions standards specified by the Transport for London in the <strong>LEZ Scheme Order.</strong> The LEC
            does not entitle you to claim for a reduced level of Vehicle Excise Duty.</p>
        <p>The certificate provides evidence of the emissions of the vehicle which meet the LEZ emissions
            standards that are in force at the time and as specified in the LEZ Scheme Order, details of which
            can be found at <strong>lezlondon.tfl.gov.uk</strong></p>
        <p>Vehicles which do not meet the required emissions level are subject to a daily charge to drive within
            the zone. From 26 September 2020 vehicles raised to the Euro IV PM standard by fitment of an
            approved particulate trap will pay a reduced daily charge provided a valid LEC is in force.</p>
        <p>If at any time the vehicle fails to satisfy the LEZ emissions standards, this certificate will not guarantee
            or entitle the vehicle to drive within the LEZ without being subject to a daily charge.</p>
        <p>This certificate must be surrendered on demand. This certificate may be revoked at any time by DVSA
            if the vehicle is subsequently found not or comply with the prescribed emission standard indicated
            overleaf or should the London LEX emissions standards change. This certificate remains the property
            of TfL and is issued by DVSA on behalf of TfL.</p>

        <h3>2. Renewal of Low Emissions Certificates</h3>
        <p>The Low Emissions Certificate is valid until the expiry date specified overleaf and must be renewed
            before that date. Vehicles with and expired certificate that do not meet the required emissions
            standards would be subject to a charge to drive within the London Low Emission Zone.</p>
        <p>The original certificate must be furnished when a vehicle is presented for a renewal test.</p>

        <h3>3. Retention and production of the certificate</h3>
        <p>You are advised to keep this certificate readily available. Transport for London will be informed within
            3 working days of issue or withdrawal of this certificate by DVSA.<br/>
            There is no need for you to register or send this certificate to TfL to drive within the London Low
            Emission Zone.</p>
        <p>You can check your vehicle’s status using the vehicle compliance checker at <strong>lezlondon.tfl.gov.uk</strong></p>

        <h3>4. Replacement certificates</h3>
        <p>Duplicates will not be issued for this certificate. If a certificate is lost or defaced then arrangements
           must be made of a Low Emissions Certificate test to be carried out and the appropriate fee paid so
           that a new certificate can be issued.</p>
        <p>If however, a certificate has been damaged and you have its identifiable remains, or if any of the
           particulars on the certificate are or have become incorrect, e.g. because of a Registration Mark
           change, the original certificate may be surrendered and replaced by an amend copy at the issuing
           Goods Vehicle Testing Station. There is no fee for a replacement certificate.</p>
